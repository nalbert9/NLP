# Introduction
In this notebook, we will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Our completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. 

## Install
- Python 3
