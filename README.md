# Natural Language Processing

We will build probabilistic and deep learning models, such as hidden Markov models and recurrent neural networks, to teach the computer to do tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and more.

## Projects Overview

### Part of Speech Tagging
>[Speech_Tagging](https://github.com/nalbert9/NLP/tree/master/Speech_Tagging): In the first project, we will use several techniques, including table lookups, n-grams, and hidden Markov models, to tag parts of speech in sentences, and compare their performance.

### Computing with Natural Language
>[Machine_Translation](https://github.com/nalbert9/NLP/tree/master/Machine_Translation): In the second project, we will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Our completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

### Communicating with Natural Language
>[Speech_Recognizer](https://github.com/nalbert9/NLP/tree/master/Speech_Recognizer): In the third project, we will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline.
